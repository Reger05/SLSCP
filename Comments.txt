I approached this problem by doing a simple mapping. There was some data I skipped over as it wasn't needed to solve the problem (County and county_code were irrelevant to getting the SLSCP for the zipcodes rate area.

As I read in the file I created a few different objects to describe the state, zipcode, rate area, and the plans. I ignored any plan that wasn't Silver (again as it wasn't needed. This information could have been saved if needed to say compare against gold plans etc). 

There are a few //TODO 's in the code to signify logging. For this problem I didn't implement any external logging due to the scope of the project.

Included in the zip is the source code, compiled classes, an executable jar file, a compile.bat, and a run.bat. 

The program will accept the where to write the file as an absolute file name or will default to dropping an output.csv in the working directory.

This was compiled and run under Java 1.8_121. It has not been tested in 1.7 but I avoided anything 1.8 specific so everything should work on 1.7 as well.

Let me know if you have any questions. 

Thank you for your time.
